CSU Program for Education & Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) awarded us funding to pursue our project titled: Integrating synthetic RNA normalization with Ribo-seq to evaluate the genome-wide impact of polyploidy at the interface of the transcriptome and the translatome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

This project marks the first (of hopefully many) collaborations between the Visger and Crawford labs here at Sacramento State.
