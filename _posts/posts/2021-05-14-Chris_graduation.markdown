Chris is officially the first Master's student from our lab.  He started with me during my second year as a PI, and I definitely learned as much from this process as he as (if not more).   On top of the typical challenges associated with graduate work, Chris also found time to get married and buy his first home, and met setbacks related to the covid pandemic with maturity and determination.

While we are all sad to see Chris move on to bigger and better things, we are all proud of his accomplishment and look forward to his next journey.
