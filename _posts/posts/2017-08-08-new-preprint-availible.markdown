You can find a preprint of our MS on the use of synthetic RNAs for transcript abundance normalization in cross ploidy gene expression level comparisons.

[Available here](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/28/169367)

Please feel free to contact Clayton if you are interested in collaborating or implementing this method on your own project.
