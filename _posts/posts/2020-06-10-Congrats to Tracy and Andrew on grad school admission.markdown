Some big congrats are in order:

Current lab member Tracy Onate was accepted to the CSUS Stem Cell MA program, and will be starting Fall 2020
Former (dare I say, the original) lab member Andrew Gonzalez was accepted to the PhD program at Washington State University, and will be starting Fall 2020

Amazing job to both of you, and we all look forward to seeing your continued success!
