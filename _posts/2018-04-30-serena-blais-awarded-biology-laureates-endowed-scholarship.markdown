Time to break the update hiatus with some good news. The Deparment of Biological Sciences awarded Serena, one of the first members to join the Visger lab, the Biology Laureates Endowed Scholarship.

Well deserved!

"The Biology Laureates Endowed Scholarship Program is a renewable scholarship program for students in the Biological Sciences.  The award will cover tuition and fees for up to four years (three years for transfer students) as long as students continue to meet the renewal criteria (see below).  We are looking for students who plan to pursue a career in STEM disciplines and have the potential to be an important contributor to the community through service, leadership, and/or research."
